# c-raycaster project

Connor Ennis, 2019

A basic raycaster engine built in C using SDL2
This is a messy expirement at the moment and
more of a learning exercise than anything. I'll
be adding more features over time, but for now
it has basic functionality.

WARNING: This one-file project is full of magic
numbers, poorly defined structs, messy memory
management, and a very innefficient raycasting
algorithm. If you managed to stumble across this
thinking you could use it for a game or something,
I recommend finding a far better engine.
